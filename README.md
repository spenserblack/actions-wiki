üåê Works across repositories (with a [PAT]) \
üìö Pretty interface for Markdown docs \
‚§¥Ô∏è Lets you open PRs for wiki docs

## Usage

‚ùó Make sure you turn on the GitHub wiki feature in your repo's settings menu.
You'll also need to _manually_ create a dummy page to initialize the git repo
that powers the GitHub wiki. If you don't, when we push to `your-repo.wiki.git`,
your workflow will fail because the wiki doesn't exist.

</div>

Create a workflow file named something like `.github/workflows/wiki.yml` and add
a job that uses this action to it! üéâ

```yml
name: Publish wiki
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: [wiki/**, .github/workflows/publish-wiki.yml]
concurrency:
  group: wiki
  cancel-in-progress: true
permissions:
  content: write
jobs:
  wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: spenserblack/actions-wiki@v0.1.1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you enable the `content: write` permission! GitHub recently
[changed the default permissions granted to jobs] for new repositories.

‚òÅÔ∏è If you're pushing to a wiki that's **not the current repository** you'll need
to get a [GitHub PAT] to push to it.

### Options

<!--
Prettier doesn't format inline HTML. See #8480 on GitHub Issues. [1] Instead,
You'll need to either wrap this in an ```html code block to abuse the formatter
and then remove the ```html wrapper, or paste it into the online Prettier
playground [2] and copy the result.

## Alternatives

There are quite a few GitHub wiki publishing actions on the [GitHub Actions
marketplace]. There are, however, two that stick out. The
[newrelic/wiki-sync-action] is a good choice for if you need bidirectional
synchronization when someone edits the live wiki. This can be beneficial for
less-technical contributors. There's also [Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action]
which is a direct competitor to this project. Specifically, it offers more
automagic ‚ú® features in exchange for more complexity.
