## Usage

![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![GitHub wiki](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+wiki&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

Getting started is easy! Just create a GitHub Actions workflow file that uses
spenserblack/actions-wiki and you're good to go! üöÄ Here's a ready-made example
to help you blast off:

```yml
name: Publish wiki
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: [wiki/**, .github/workflows/publish-wiki.yml]
concurrency:
  group: wiki
  cancel-in-progress: true
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: spenserblack/actions-wiki@<version>
        with:
          # Whatever directory you choose will be mirrored to the GitHub
          # .wiki.git. The default is .github/wiki.
          path: wiki
```

<img align="right" alt="Screenshot of 'Create the first page' button" src="https://i.imgur.com/ABKIS4h.png" />

‚ùó Make sure you turn on the GitHub wiki feature in your repo's settings menu.
You'll also need to _manually_ create a dummy page to initialize the git repo
that powers the GitHub wiki. If you don't, when we push to `your-repo.wiki.git`,
your workflow will fail because the wiki doesn't exist.

‚ö†Ô∏è You'll need to remember to enable the `contents: write` permission! GitHub
recently [changed the default permissions granted to jobs] for new repositories.

### Publishing to a different repository

If you're pushing to a wiki that's **not the current repository** you'll need to
get a [GitHub PAT] to push to it. The default `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
won't cut it! You can [generate a PAT] in your GitHub Settings.

For example, if you created octocat/gigantic-mega-project-wiki to hold the wiki
and you want to publish it to the GitHub wiki that belongs to _another
repository_ like octocat/gigantic-mega-project, you'd use a step like this in
one of your GitHub Actions workflows.

```yml
- uses: spenserblack/actions-wiki@<version>
  with:
    path: .
    # This will push this repo (octocat/gigantic-mega-project-wiki) to the
    # wiki of the octocat/gigantic-mega-project repository.
    repository: octocat/gigantic-mega-project
    # Make sure this token has the appropriate push permissions!
    token: ${{ secrets.GIGANTIC_MEGA_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Options

- **`repository`:** The repository housing the wiki. Use this if you're
  publishing to a wiki that's not the current repository. You can change the
  GitHub server with the `github-server-url:` input. Default is
  `${{ github.repository }}`.

- **`github-server-url`:** An alternate `https://github.com` URL, usually for
  GitHub Enterprise deployments under your own domain. Default is
  `${{ github.server_url }}` (usually `https://github.com`).

- **`token`:** `${{ github.token }}` is the default. This token is used when
  cloning and pushing wiki changes.

- **`path`:** The directory to use for your wiki contents. Default:
  `.github/wiki`.

- **`commit-message`:** The message to use when committing new content. Default
  is `Update wiki ${{ github.sha }}`. You probably don't need to change this,
  since this only applies if you look _really closely_ in your wiki.

- **`dry-run`:** Whether or not to actually attempt to push changes back to the
  wiki itself. If this is set to `true`, we instead print the remote URL and do
  not push to the remote wiki. The default is `false`. This is useful for
  testing.

## Alternatives

There are quite a few GitHub wiki publishing actions on the [GitHub Actions
marketplace]. There are, however, two that stick out. The
[newrelic/wiki-sync-action] is a good choice for if you need bidirectional
synchronization when someone edits the live wiki. This can be beneficial for
less-technical contributors. There's also [Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action]
which is a direct competitor to this project. It offers more automatic features,
but has more complex configuration. It also [doesn't support `runs-on:
windows-*`].

## Development

![YAML](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=YAML&color=CB171E&logo=YAML&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Bash](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Bash&color=4EAA25&logo=GNU+Bash&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

This is a GitHub Action, so we inevitably use YAML[^1]. Make sure you quote the
right things! To test üß™ the action, the current workflow is to open a PR and
then have the [`test.yml`] workflow run a `dry-run: true` iteration to
(hopefully) spot any flaws.
