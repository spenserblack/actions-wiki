🚀 For a seamless coding experience, we recommend using VS Code or GitHub
Codespaces as your editor! With VS Code's extensions and customizable settings,
you can tailor your environment to suit your preferences. 🌟 Plus, for GitHub
Codespaces users, we provide a `devcontainer.json` config for a ready-to-use
development environment. 🛠️ Enhance your coding productivity and enjoyment with
these powerful editors! 😊

We use [EditorConfig] to specify the spacing and file conventions for this
project. Make sure you _try_ to conform with it. Editors like VS Code have
extensions that will do this automatically for you! 😉
